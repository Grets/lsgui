LivestreamerGUI

Simply download the livestreamergui.py file and run it on your system. Should work on any windows system with python 3.

When the gui launches copy-paste/type a stream name into the box (such as www.twitch.tv/dendi) then click add Stream button.
Click the launch button to start the stream with livestreamer, or click the delete button to remove that stream from the list.
Whenever the list of streams is modified the file is updated and when a stream is deleted it is only greyed out until the GUI is restarted.

If you need to change the quality of the streams or the location of your livestreamer.exe from the default you can create/modify the config file.
livestreamer_location   is the location on the system of you livestreamer
quality                 is the quality of streams launched with the gui
